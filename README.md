Please create your own directory with your name and create __Answers.js__ file inside.  
  
In __Answers.js__ file you should export an array with functions inside. Like:
    
    export default [ function1, function2, ... ]
    
And change the code in __AddSix.js__ :  
    
    import Answers from '/Answers.js'
    
to  
    
    import Answers from '/yourname/Answers.js'

You should see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] as many as your Answers' length in the console.
